Perform the task of the laboratory work using the interpolation algorithm to build a vector image of a 2D, 3D graphic object.
The display of a 3D figure is realised using an ascension projection of any type
Choose independently: library, size of the graphic window, size of the figure, dynamics of changing the position of the figure, colour scheme of the graphic object. All conversion operations must be performed within the graphical window.
Shape: parallelepiped
Interpolation method: Bezier curves
Method for removing invisible lines and surfaces: select by yourself
